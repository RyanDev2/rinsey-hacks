# FIRST EVER RELEASED RESOURCE

This is the first resource I originally created using OXLIB, but it has now been rebuilt with a custom UI. This release represents the initial iteration of my work with user interfaces, and it is triggered by a command. Please note that this is not a finished resource, but rather an early version showcasing my progress in UI development.
